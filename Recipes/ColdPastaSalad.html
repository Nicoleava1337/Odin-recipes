        <h2><p><u>Instructions</u></p></h2>

    <p><h4>Boil & Cool Pasta</h4></p>        
    Cook pasta according to directions on package, but just under al dente about 6 minutes. Add pasta to colander and rince under cold water to stop cooking. The pasta will take on some of the dressing so if cooked too long it will end up soggy.
