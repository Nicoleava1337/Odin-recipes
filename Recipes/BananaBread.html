    <p><h4>Step 4: Bake the bread</h4></p>
        Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Insert into preheated oven and set timer for 55 to 65 minutes, or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.
